# Using semantic web to auto generate tags

## What is semantic web

Traditional web is a document in the form of html and other web elements that is just for human viewing. It is stuctured only for  the
presentation to the human beings. A machine cannot reason or make meaning with traditional web.

Semantic web is a more powerful web tool which helps the contents in the web to be structured in a more systematic way in which they are structured
and linked according to their real life meanings. For example, for a word say "cat", with the tool like semantic web, it should be able to reason 
and point to wikipedia article describing cats. Here say the object is called cat in ontology (see below) myon represented as myon:cat then we can
say that its description is in the wikipedia article. (myon:cat myon:description <"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat">). In real life things are
all interconnected in some way and hence semantic web can show the interconnection. That means we can always represent it in a form of a 3-tuple 
(resource property value). It is called a 3-tuple RDF format which gives certain property to certain web objects for their meaning.

## Web Ontologies

An ontology is the study of a concept. An ontology can encompass all of the web objects that are related to a certain concept and structure them in a
certain ordered fashion. An ontology can also use the terms from other ontologies to describe an object. For example, we have a medical ontology named
med and a common ontology com which describes the property name, which gives the name to something. Then we have (med:amnesia com:name "Amnesia") and 
(med:amnesia com:name "Memory Loss") which gives the names "Amnesia" and "Memory Loss" to a web object named amnesia in med. A web object is usually 
represented as a tag in a xml file which represents the ontology in common RDF/XML format. An ontology often has a url associated with it and the web
objects in it as #id's.

## My Ontology

I built an ontology of emoji's used in messages, chats or comments using protege and associated them with their meanings. Details about emoji's that I
used as reference are [here](http://unicode.org/emoji/charts/full-emoji-list.html). Emoji's are popular tools that are used to represent emotions in chats
and comments. They are represented using unicodes. I used the keywords after it to build the ontology and associate emoji's with meanings and tags. These 
annotations themselves are structured according to the meanings (synonyms and class hierarchy are also semantic web features).  The screenshots of protege 
showing the ontology is as below.

Protege is a graphical and effective tool to generate ontology in xml form without the creater having to write long codes themselves. A part of xml that 
represents my ontology is given below. It is for an emoji which is represented by unicode 0x1f495 and is called "two hearts". 

```xml
 <NamedIndividual rdf:about="&emoji_ontology;emoji145">
        <emoji_ontology:unicode rdf:datatype="&xsd;hexBinary">1f495</emoji_ontology:unicode>
        <emoji_ontology:year rdf:datatype="&xsd;integer">2010</emoji_ontology:year>
        <emoji_ontology:description rdf:datatype="&xsd;string">two hearts</emoji_ontology:description>
        <emoji_ontology:hasAnnotation rdf:resource="&emoji_ontology;emotion"/>
        <emoji_ontology:hasAnnotation rdf:resource="&emoji_ontology;heart"/>
        <emoji_ontology:hasAnnotation rdf:resource="&emoji_ontology;love"/>
        <emoji_ontology:hasAnnotation rdf:resource="&emoji_ontology;person"/>
    </NamedIndividual>

```

The name of my ontology in above code is emoji_ontology.

## Application

I created a small web application which takes a message/comment which is written into a box and tags are generated for the comment. The general path for
execution is as follows.

* First the message is analysed by the client using javascript. An emoji is represented by a UTF-16 unicode which can take a surrogate pair (two code-units) in
the javascript string. A surrogate pair has first code at >=8d00 and second at >=8c00 which is reserved to represent higher unicodes. Javascript can detect and
discover the emoji's like that. Since HTTP may not support higher unicodes, it is converted to a string with unicodes of emoji's only separated by ":" and sent
to a servlet server.

* The servlet separates the unicodes, discovers the emoji's and then queries the ontlogy using SPARQL (see below). It then gets the keywords to generate hashtags
and sends to client.
* The client then displays the tags.

## Query and SPARQL

We need a tool to read and query our ontology. JAVA has a tool which can retrieve ontologies from RDF/XML formatted ontology files and query it using
SPARQL. SPARQL is an ontology query language which can select items from ontologies or modify them as in a relational database with the added feature
of reasoning by ontologies. 

We need a library called Jena in Java which can be downloaded [here](http://mirrors.noc.im/apache/jena/binaries/apache-jena-3.1.0.tar.gz) to operate with
the ontologies. An example SPARQL query to retrieve all the annotations of the emoji with unicode 0x1f495 from my ontology is:

```
	PREFIX emoji:<http://www.semanticweb.org/manish/ontologies/2016/0/emoji_ontology#>
	PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>
    SELECT ?an WHERE {
    ?em emoji:hasAnnotation ?an. 
    ?em emoji:unicode ?unicode.
    FILTER( ?unicode = "1f495"^^xsd:hexBinary)}

```

The codes for my app are [here](https://github.com/manishad119/hwork2). Note that it does not include the Jena libraris.
