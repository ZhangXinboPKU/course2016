# Using Cordova (Phonegap) to develop web application and using features like geolocation and maps

## What is cordova

Cordova is a framework which uses web elements (like html, css and javascript) to develop web applications. Simply put 
cordova uses HTML and CSS to design pages for the given mobile applications and use Javascript as primary programming 
language. It is stored in the programme and the application provided primarily works as a simple web browser which uses
the client side web contents as programme elements.

Cordova has many similarities as well as many differences from traditional programming and web browsers. Since most mobile 
applications need to frequently connect to the Internet, it may be desirable for it to have web-page like quality. Furthurmore,
many applications today are merely mobile versions of their websites. Since, web elements are more powerful for this purpose than 
other programming languages like Java for Android or Objective C for iOS, cordova is becoming popular now a days. It is also more
 platform independent than its other counterparts.


## Introduction

I have developed a simple Cordova app that allows users to burrow and lend things that are nearby. This app allows users to search things
 or people nearby and also publish things that are available to lend. It uses googlemap api to load maps and also give the location of where
 the object is using the marker. 

## Using Google map api

To use the Google map api we need the googlemap javascript which provides codes for the use of map and constructors for map objects. gmaps.js that
I downloaded from Google provides mathods and constructors for GMaps() objects. I included the javascript provided by Google 
<https://maps.google.com/maps/api/js?sensor=true> as well for loading of maps. I used folowing code to create and load the new map in the map div "map"
 which actually acts as page in a cordova application and loads to the current location. Clicking the map puts marker at the clicked location in the
  map.
  
```javascript
 var loc = getCurrentLocation();
    map = new GMaps({
        div: '#map',
        zoom: 16,
        lng: loc.longitude,
        lat: loc.latitude,
        click: function(e){
            window.addMarker(e.latLng.lng(), e.latLng.lat());
        }.bind(window)
    });
```

To put a marker at a location (lat,lng), we use the following code


```javascript

    if(marker){map.removeMarker(marker);}
    marker = map.addMarker({
        lng: lng,
        lat: lat,
        title: "Item Address"
    });
    $("#publish-lng").val(lng);
    $("#publish-lat").val(lat);
    $(".map-btn").html("Location Already Set");
    url = "http://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/json?latlng="+lat+","+lng+"&sensor=true";
    $.ajax({
        method: "GET",
        url: url,
        success: function(data){
            var res = data["results"];
            if(!res){return false;}
            var j = 0;
            for (i in res){
                if (i == j){
                    var add = res[i];
                    if(add){
                        var comp = add["formatted_address"];
                        if(!comp){j = 1;continue;}
                        $("#publish-address").val(comp);

                    }
                }
            }
        }.bind(window)
    });
	
```

The above code puts a marker at any location and also uses the url eg. <http://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/json?latlng=27.5,27.5&sensor=true"g>
to get more information about the location eg. formatted address. The marker is actually the indication of last visited location that needs to be sent to 
the server of my app as the location of good. The publishing page is as follows.

After clicking the "Set Location" button, a map page is shown where you can choose the location of the item to be published. The above code then adds marker
there and sets the location (latitude, longitude) as well as the formatted address obtained from the above mentioned url to some hidden elements in the page
that will be sent to server.

## Geolocation

GMaps also helps in geo-location or locating current address. The getCurrentLocation() function in above code uses the following code to get the location
we currently are at. Geolocation is an important tool and our app uses it to find nearby people or items.

```javascript
GMaps.geolocate({
        success: function(position) {
            window.locati = {"latitude": position.coords.latitude, "longitude": position.coords.longitude};
        }.bind(window)
    });
```

geolocate(function) of GMaps gets current address as position.cocords.
